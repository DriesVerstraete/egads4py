# egads4py

egads4py is a direction python wrapper for the EGADS API. 
EGADS ("Engineering Geometry Aircraft Design System") provides routines for bottom-up constructive solid geometry modeling built on OpenCASCADE. 
EGADS is distributed with the Engineering Sketch Pad under the LGPL v.2.1.

The purpose of egads4py is to provide access at a python level to all C-level functionality to facilitate the scripting of geometry construction for engineering analysis.
